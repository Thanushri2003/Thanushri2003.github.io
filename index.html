            <h3>Artificial Intelligence with Python</h3>
            <p>
                This project focuses on leveraging the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a standard collection of clothing images, to develop and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for multi-class classification tasks. The Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images, each sized at 28x28 pixels, representing 10 different fashion categories. The objective is to accurately classify these images using TensorFlow and Keras, employing CNNs to extract hierarchical features and make predictions based on learned patterns. By utilizing convolutional layers to extract features, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, ReLU activation functions for efficiency, and fully connected layers for final classification, the CNN architecture efficiently processes and categorizes the images. This project aims to demonstrate effective image classification techniques applicable to real-world scenarios, such as developing recommendation systems based on customer preferences in fashion.

            <h3>Innovative Approaches to Wildfire Monitoring - UAV Enabled RGB/IR Imaging for Accurate Detection</h3>
            <p>
                This deep learning-based project focuses on fire classification and localization to enhance wildfire monitoring using UAV-enabled RGB/IR imaging. The project explores diverse approaches and methodologies aimed at improving wildfire detection. It investigates the potential benefits and challenges associated with multi-modal datasets in the context of wildfire monitoring. Furthermore, the project integrates deep learning techniques for wildfire detection and examines hybrid approaches that combine different methods for fire localization. The goal is to develop effective strategies for early detection and precise localization of wildfires, contributing to more efficient wildfire management and mitigation efforts.

            <h3>Graphical User Interface Project - Airline Reservation System in Java</h3>
            <p>
                This project is an Airline Reservation System featuring essential functionalities such as booking flights, canceling bookings, viewing booking history, and managing user profiles. Implemented using Java Swing for the graphical user interface, the system provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction. JDBC is employed to facilitate database operations, storing and retrieving data from MySQL databases. The project aims to demonstrate effective use of GUI development in Java and database integration for managing airline reservations efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                NetBeans IDE was utilized for the development, leveraging its robust features and integrated development environment tailored for Java applications. The IDE streamlined development processes, offering tools for GUI design, code editing, debugging, and database management, ensuring efficient project implementation.

            During the "Introduction to Public Policy" course at SASTRA University, I participated in a team project aimed at creating a farmer-friendly website titled "Friends of Farmers" for the village of Sennampatti. The website serves as a comprehensive resource, providing essential agricultural information about new emerging technologies, methods, and schemes beneficial for the economic growth of farmers. This initiative helps bridge the information gap and supports farmers in adopting modern practices. You can visit the website at <a href="https://sastrapublicpolicies.github.io/friendoffarmer/" target="_blank">Friends of Farmers</a>.
